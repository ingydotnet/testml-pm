TestML
======

A Generic Software Testing Meta Language

= TESTML IS NOT ON CPAN

TestML works great in Perl (5 and 6) and you can use it to write tests for your
CPAN modules; but you don't install TestML from CPAN.

See https://github.com/testml-lang/testml/wiki/TestML-and-CPAN for the full
details.
