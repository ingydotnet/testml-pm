Module::Install::TestML
=======================

Module::Install Support for TestML

= Synopsis

  use inc::Module::Install;

  name     'Foo';
  all_from 'lib/Foo.pm';

  use_testml_tap;

  WriteAll;

= Description

This module adds the `use_testml_tap` directive to Module::Install.

Now you can get full TestML support for your module with no external
dependency on TestML.

Just add this line to your Makefile.PL:

  use_testml_tap;

That's it. Really. Now Test::Base is bundled into your module, so that it is
no longer any burden on the person installing your module.
