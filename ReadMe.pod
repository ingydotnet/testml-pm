TestML - A Generic Software Testing Meta Language

=head1 TESTML IS NOT ON CPAN

TestML works great in Perl (5 and 6) and you can use it to write tests for
your CPAN modules; but you don't install TestML from CPAN.

See L<https://github.com/testml-lang/testml/wiki/TestML-and-CPAN> for the
full details.
